This is a sandbox, in the spirit of Cloudius Systems' OSv.

The goal is to provide a secure, sandboxed execution mechanism that
enables deterministic input, processing and output.  Execution is
separated out into distinct phases:

1. Prepare and load hash-sealed program executables, data.
2. Execute program as a black box, with no I/O capability.
   Runs until exit or CPU budget exhausted (or CPU exception).
3. Gather processed data, if any.

A single thread of execution pre-loads necessary data, then simulates a
32-bit little endian Moxie CPU, running the loaded code.

This program is built using the "moxiebox" target in upstream binutils
and gcc.  A reduced (C-only) gcc toolchain is therefore available for
immediate use by developers.

You will need to build and install moxie architecture
binutils+gcc cross-compiler toolset:

```bash
    cd contrib
    ./download-tools-sources.sh
    ./build-moxiebox-tools.sh
```

From the Moxie program's point of view, it is a single thread running
as root and is essentially the entire operating system kernel +
application, all in a single wrapper.

From the sandbox's point of view, the application is running as an
unpriv'd application with only the ability to access data within the
hand-built memory map.

More info about the Moxie architecture may be found at
http://moxielogic.org/blog/pages/architecture.html and
http://moxielogic.org/blog/ . The main code repository is
https://github.com/atgreen/moxie-cores.

Example usage:

	./sandbox \
		-e runtime/test1 \
		-d mydata.json \
		-d mydata2.dat \
		-o file.out

If you specify the -g <port> option, then sandbox will wait for a GDB
connection on the given port.  For example, run sandbox like so:

    $ ./sandbox -e ./basic -g 9999
    ep 00001000
    ro 00000f6c-00001536 elf0
    ro 00001538-00001540 elf1
    rw 00001640-00001ab4 elf2
    rw 00002ab4-00012ab4 stack
    ro 00013ab4-00013b74 mapdesc
    
And, in a separate console, run GDB to connect to sandbox using the
`target remote` command like so:

    $ moxiebox-gdb basic
